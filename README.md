# Tournament of Power

## Overview

The game concept is reminiscent of rock, paper, scissors, but with a unique twist featuring lives and charges. Drawing inspiration from Dragon Ball, players can charge to execute an attack and block to prevent life reduction. It's crucial to note that players cannot attack without a charge stack. Each player starts with 3 lives, and losing all lives results in the game ending.

## Usage
Select your choice (charge attack or block) by clicking on the corresponding button.
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The result of the round will be displayed, and your remaining lives will be updated.
Keep playing until you defeat the computer or lose all your lives.

## Game Logic
Charge attack defeats block.
Block deflects charge attack.
If both players choose the same option, it's a draw and no lives are deducted.
